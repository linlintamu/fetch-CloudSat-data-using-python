# fetch-CloudSat-data-using-python

Instead of using a perl script provided by the CloudSat team, this code serves as a complementary to download CloudSat data using python. 
fetch "a large amount of" CloudSat data from the ftp server automatically.
if you are downloading 1-2 pieces of CloudSat data, you can download manually.
